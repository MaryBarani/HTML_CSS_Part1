  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Heat the oven to 400°F.
      Remove salmon from fridge.
      Pat dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel.
      Using your hands, gently rub each fillet all over with a thin layer of olive oil.
      Season with salt and pepper. Let fillets rest at room temperature, 10-30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Thinly slice one lemon and juice the other.
      Cut 4 sheets of parchment paper (or aluminum foil) into heart shapes and place on a sheet pan.
      Fold the parchment in half.
      Divide the lemon slices evenly between the packets, placing on one side of the fold.
      Place salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. Sprinkle each fillet with lemon juice.
      Top with dill sprigs, then fold the other side of the paper over and crimp the rounded edge tightly.
      You want to have enough room for the steam to puff up the packages and cook the salmon,
      while making the crimping tight enough to ensure the packets won’t fall apart.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake 10-15 minutes, until the thickest part of the salmon is almost cooked through.
      Remove from the oven and serve immediately, or, for more well done salmon,
      allow to rest in packets for 3–10 minutes.
    </li>
</ol>
